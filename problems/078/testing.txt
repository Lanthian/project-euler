The first 15 values to the coin piles formula are seen below. 

1 : 1
2 : 2    
3 : 3    
4 : 5    
5 : 7    
6 : 11   
7 : 15   
8 : 22   
9 : 30   
10 : 42  
11 : 56  
12 : 77  
13 : 101 
14 : 135 
15 : 176 

An approach to try modelling them:
For each number 'n', recursively calculate the coin piles of possible divisions. In the following, p' refers to p but 
    limited such that it can only be made with numbers smaller than or equal to it's guard, 'g &'.
  
  p(n) = n & p'(0) +
    n-1 & p'(1) +
    n-2 & p'(2) +
    ... +
    2 & p'(n-2) +
    1 & p'(n-1)
    == [n] + [n-1,1] + [n-2,2; n-2,1,1] + ... + [2,(n-1)*1; ...] + [n*1]
    == 1 + 1 + 2 + 


  Example for n = 4.

  p(4) = 4 & p'(0) + 
    3 & p'(1) + 
    2 & p'(2) +
    1 & p'(3)
    == [4] + [3,1] + [2,2; 2,1,1] + [1,1,1,1]
    == 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 == 5


  And an example for n = 5

  p(5) = 5 & p'(0) +
    4 & p'(1) +
    3 & p'(2) + 
    2 & p'(3) +
    1 & p'(4)
    == [5] + [4,1] + [3,2; 3,1,1] + [2,2,1; 2,1,1,1] + [1,1,1,1,1]
    == 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 == 7


A clear problem with this approach is recalculating the p' values in regards to their changing guards. A simpler 
  realisation is that the guard of each p value increases by 1 each iteration. Replacing g & p'(n) with P(g,n), we 
  observe the following.

  P(1,n) = 1
  P(2,1) = 1
    P(2,2) = 2
    P(2,3) = 2
    P(2,4) = 3
    P(2,5) = 3
    P(2,n) = n//2 + 1
  P(3,1) = 1
    P(3,2) = 2
    P(3,3) = 3
    P(3,4) = 4
    P(3,5) = 4
    P(3,6) = 7 ...
  
  Pattern gets much more complex as it builds up - no clear simple algebraic expression
